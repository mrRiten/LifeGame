# LifeGame

__LifeGame__ it`s simple life simulator where you can watch the merciless 
struggle for survival between the offenders of this small world - __LBlocks__.

This game develop(ed/ing) on the Python with PyGame, so you can meet
a lot of lags and bugs :)

The game is under active development and every week I will try to add
something new and interesting here.

If you want to run the game now, you can clone this repository.

Some sitting moments:
```python
LBlockConstructor.create_block_start(l_blocks, <count_of_blocks>)
```
Run game with <count_of_blocks> at start

For the present that`s all...



*P.s. This is my first project on this topic.*
